                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> Willy! Thanks for sitting down with us. To start, tell us about yourself.</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> Thanks for having me! I’m 19, from the outskirts of Mokopane in Limpopo, South Africa. I’m 6’1, and I like to think of myself as a blend of creative and analytical. I’ve always been drawn to modeling, coding, arts, entrepreneurship and even statistics. I guess you could call me a multi-hyphenate, trying to carve my own lane.</p>

                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> That’s a lot to balance. How did you discover these passions?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> It started young. I was fascinated by creativity first, drawing, photography, performing. But I also loved solving problems, math, building machines from scrap, and seeing how these systems worked. One day it clicked to me, I can be everything I want to be in the world, why choose one when I can explore all? Each side fuels the other now. Creativity makes my technical work more innovative, and my tech stuff keeps my creative projects organized.</p>

                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> Do people find it hard to understand that mix?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> Absolutely! Some people ask, “Why coding when you’re modeling?” or “Why modeling when you’re an engineer?” But I’ve realized that my identity isn’t linear. I’m learning to embrace all parts of myself, the artsy, the techy, the entrepreneurial. THAT'S WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS!</p>

                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> What’s a typical day in the life of Willy?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> Haha, there isn’t really a “typical” day! Some mornings I’m running photoshoots or editing content. Afternoons, I dive into coding or experiment with a new project. Evenings might be networking, learning new skills, or brainstorming creative ideas. I try to keep a balance between being productive and staying inspired.</p>

            </div>
                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> With so many areas of interest, do you ever feel overwhelmed?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> ALL THE TIME! There are days I feel like I’m juggling too many things and have headaches. But I’ve learned to organize priorities and give each passion space to breathe. Sometimes I batch creative work, sometimes coding work, sometimes school, I am still a Stats student. The key is respecting the process and understanding that growth isn’t linear.</p>

                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> That makes sense. Tell us about your journey so far — what have been the highlights?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> There are so many. From trying to gain attention on social media to landing modeling gigs to submitting webwork assignments, all of that has taught me something. One of the biggest lessons was realizing that failure isn’t a setback, it’s data! When something doesn’t work, I analyze it, learn, and try again. That mindset comes from both coding and creative projects; they both reward persistence and experimentation.</p>

                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> Speaking of challenges, what’s been the hardest part?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> Honestly, self-doubt. Early on, I questioned whether I could really establish myself in multiple fields simultaneously. Ihave failed soo many tests, missed deadlines and people would tell me to pick one path. But I’ve learned that the key is to trust your vision. The big version of yourself is always ahead of where you are now and to be honest, that’s exciting.</p>

            </div>
                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> How do you stay motivated?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> I visualize the future I want. I imagine the projects I’ll create, the impact I’ll make, and the people I’ll inspire. Then I break it down into daily actions — coding a feature, shooting a photoshoot, networking with mentors. Every small step adds up.</p>

                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> What’s something people might not know about Willy?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> That I thrive on challenges and risks. People see polished content or finished projects, but they don’t always see the late nights, the experiments that fail, or the moments I question myself. That’s all part of growth, and I embrace it. Also, I’m a huge fan of blending tech and art in ways most people wouldn’t expect, that’s my signature.</p>

                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> Where do you see yourself in five years?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> I see myself bigger... not just in recognition, but in impact. I want to create projects that inspire and connect with people across multiple industries. I want to be known as someone who can bridge worlds, tech, creative, business and show others that versatility is a strength.</p>

                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> If you could give advice to someone trying to balance multiple passions, what would it be?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> Don’t limit yourself. Society wants to put people in boxes. Your interests are your superpower. Embrace them, even if they seem unrelated. Focus on learning, experimenting, and documenting your journey. In time, all the pieces will connect.</p>

                <p><strong>Editor:</strong> Last question, what’s your current mantra or motto?</p>
                <p><strong>Willy:</strong> “Grow unapologetically.” Never shrink yourself to fit expectations. Push limits, explore, and trust your vision. That’s how you reach your ‘big’ self.</p>
